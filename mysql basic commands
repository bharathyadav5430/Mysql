Day 1: Introduction to Databases and Basic Commands
We kicked off by exploring fundamental SQL commands to manage databases and tables:

SHOW DATABASES: Lists all databases.
CREATE DATABASE techforallwithnikhil: Creates a new database.
USE techforallwithnikhil: Switches to the database.
CREATE TABLE employee: We created a simple employee table with columns like FirstName, LastName, Age, and Salary.

Sample Query:

INSERT INTO employee(FirstName, LastName, Age, Salary, Location)
VALUES ("NIKHIL", "NEGI", 21, 1500, "Delhi");
Some key data types covered were:

INT: Integer values
VARCHAR: Variable-length strings
TIMESTAMP: Date and time values

By the end of Day 1, we learned how to insert data, query data using SELECT *, filter data with WHERE, and even update or delete specific records.
